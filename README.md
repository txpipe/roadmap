# TxPipe Development Roadmap

> [Access Live Roadmap Board](https://github.com/orgs/txpipe/projects/6/views/1)

The goal of this roadmap is to provide information about what we're working on and what to expect in the following months.

## How to Read the Roadmap

The actual information lives in a Github project. Each item in the project represents a new feature or some relevant change. They should be interpreted as milestones and not as concrete tasks.

> **Note**
> Concrete and actionable tasks can be found as Github issues in the repositories of each corresponding tool.

### Available Fields

Each feature in the roadmap provides a particular set of fields:

- `Tool`: a reference to the tool to which this feature belongs.
- `Status`: a reference inidicating the current development phase of the feature.
- `Quarter`: a reference to the year & quarter in which we're planning to release the feature.
- `Catalyst` a reference to the Catalyst fund in which the feature was funded (if any)

### Available Views

The Github project provides several views to access the information from different perspectives:

- [Timeline](https://github.com/orgs/txpipe/projects/6/views/1): presents the features in a board layout, according to the expected release date.
- [By Tool](https://github.com/orgs/txpipe/projects/6/views/2): presents the features in a table layout, grouped by the tool to which they belong.
- [Dev Status](https://github.com/orgs/txpipe/projects/6/views/3): presents the features in a board layout, organized by development progress.
- [Catalyst](https://github.com/orgs/txpipe/projects/6/views/5): filters features that were funded by Catalyst, organized by fund.


## Disclaimer

This is our best effort to provide long-term visibility of our development process, but we understand that priorities are dynamic and estimations aren't always as accurate as we would like.

Dates and scope found in this roadmap must not be interpreted as a strict commitment from TxPipe side. Please, assume that this information can change.
